#50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript
This is a repository dedicated to showcasing my journey in completing the course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" from Udemy.com.

##Purpose
The goal of this course is to help sharpen your skills by building 50 unique, fun, and quick mini projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will be customizing each project to make it my own, using different images, styles, and a single CSS file to style every project.

##Accessibility
All projects will be accessible through a main or index website for easy navigation.

##Additional Feature
I have added an extra touch to my project by creating a batch file that will generate the initial 50 HTML files required for each project, which can be found in the html folder.

So, follow along and join me on this exciting journey to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
